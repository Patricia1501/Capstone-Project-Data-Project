* The car dataset is a commonly used dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains information about various attributes of cars, such as name of the car, selling price, fuel efficiency, kilometers driven, transmission, and the owner. The dataset is often used for tasks such as regression, classification, or clustering.
* The car dataset typically includes both categorical and numerical variables. This dataset is valuable for analyzing and predicting various aspects of cars, such as their market value, performance, or fuel efficiency.
* Researchers and data scientists often use the car dataset to train and test machine learning models for tasks like predicting car prices, classifying cars based on their attributes, or clustering similar cars together. The dataset can also be utilized for exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and deriving insights about car features and trends.
* By working with the car dataset, data scientists can gain practical experience in data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. It provides a valuable resource for understanding and applying various data science techniques and algorithms in the context of automotive data.

Steps used in creating the Car Price Prediction Project:<br>
1)Data Exploration <br>
2)Data Insights <br>
3)Data Cleaning and Preprocessing <br>
4)Exploratory Data Analysis <br>
5)Model Building <br>
6)Deployment of ML Model <br>

Aim:<br>
This data science project is aimed at predicting the selling price of used cars in the market based on several factors such as the kilometers driven, year, fuel type, owner, seller type, and transmission. Through the various steps of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model building, we were able to build a highly accurate Gradient Boosting Regression model with an R2 Score of over 48%. The final step of deploying the model into a Streamlit app made it easy for users to access and generate predictions instantly. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of the model could be improved further by incorporating additional information such as the mileage, condition, and other relevant factors. Nevertheless, the results of this project demonstrate the power of machine learning in providing valuable insights and predictions in the second-hand car market.![image](https://github.com/Patricia1501/Capstone-Project-Data-Project/assets/130581948/f0f0557e-2af6-4106-b9ef-23a00f021b7b)
